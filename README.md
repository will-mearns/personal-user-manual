# Personal User Manual

Welcome to my Personal User Manual! You may want to read [The Pitch/Anti-Pitch for Personal User Manuals](https://medium.com/@caminmccluskey/personal-user-manuals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-template-7b80db5044ea) first as this explains what these are about.

## About Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I grew up in the midwest (Indiana) and stayed for college and a bit after. I've been in Austin since 2014 and joined Unity at the end of 2020. Some of my hobbies include sand volleyball, rock climbing, running, biking, stand up paddleboarding, gaming (video/board), and cult classic movies.

## How to Contact Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Slack will be the easiest way to reach me, as I try to clear out my notifications every day. Emails may be lost for a week or two, so if you send something important via email, follow up with a Slack! As I'm sometimes in multiple mind spaces at once, I prefer important links/discussions/etc to be in writing, but a quick Zoom call or huddle is nice for long conversations or getting alignment/walking through something.

## Preferred Working Style


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
My flexible working hours are usually between 8am and 6pm central. I'm not a huge fan of meetings before 9, but I'm fine with some meetings at that time if it isn't every day of the week. I also like to at least be out in the sun for a little each day, so during the winters, I may prefer earlier finish times.

## What Motivates Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I enjoy working on creative projects,training/helping others, and pulling insights by working with data.
</details>

## What Demotivates Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
My biggest motivator is probably working on something that no one will use or care about. Another big one is trying to solve problems that are outside of my control (or give the appearance of being so).

## My Values (and what I value in others)


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I strive to be a servant leader for my teams and give them what they need to be happy at work. Part of this is having empathy and compassion for their specific scenarios. Part of it is organizing and guiding the work teams set out to accomplish. I always like to see others similarly and helping everyone as much as they can.

## My Blind Spots


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
The one spot that I've been having trouble covering is maintaining our backlog from a product and engineering perspective. I also haven't been able to cover a lot of things from the program perspective, since I've been trying to cover the low-level team gaps.

## Other


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
- "How I like my 1:1s" - Without an agenda and an open space to talk about whatever we want to, maybe 50% of the time relating to work.
- "How to interpret my calendar" - Maybe's can be double booked. I won't attend meeting invites that overlap with my "Personal" calendar items. Ask before double-booking time I've blocked off for myself as it usually means I need to finish something for a deadline.
- "What you can expect from me" - I try to meet with everyone at least once a month, so we can catch up and have time to work through whatever we need to. If I say I will do something, I will do it; sometimes it is just a question of when as my calendar sometimes have overlapping priorities.
