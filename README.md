# Personal User Manual

Welcome to my Personal User Manual! You may want to read [The Pitch/Anti-Pitch for Personal User Manuals](https://medium.com/@caminmccluskey/personal-user-manuals-the-good-the-bad-and-the-template-7b80db5044ea) first as this explains what these are about. To create your own, you can branch off this or [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## About Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
I grew up in the midwest (Indiana) and stayed for college and a bit after. I've been in Austin since 2014 and joined Unity at the end of 2020. Some of my hobbies include sand volleyball, rock climbing, running, biking, stand up paddleboarding, gaming (video/board), and cult classic movies.

## How to Contact Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Slack will be the easiest way to reach me, as I try to clear out my notifications every day. Emails will be lost for a week or two at a time, so if you send something important via email, follow up with a Slack. As I'm sometimes in multiple mind spaces at once, I prefer important links/discussions/etc to be in writing, but a quick Zoom call or huddle is nice for long conversations or getting alignment/walking through something.

## Preferred Working Style


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
My flexible working hours are usually between 8am and 6pm central. I'm not a huge fan of meetings before 9, but I'm fine with some meetings at that time if it isn't every day of the week. 
</details>

## What Motivates Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Recommended Section: Think about what gives you energy in work. What, about the work that you do, motivates you to push yourself? This doesn't need to be inspirational, it can be as simple as you enjoying seeing the results. The purpose of this section is to help your line manager and squad members to gain a picture of the work each person finds meaningful and interesting.
</details>

## What Demotivates Me


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Recommended Section: The flip side of the above. Everyone has parts of their work they find less interesting, and they won't be the same for everyone. You never know, a task you find impossibly tedious might be something someone else really enjoys - if so, you've discovered a win-win!
</details>

## My Values (and what I value in others)


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Recommended Section: Accepting that we all treat each other with empathy, care and respect as a baseline. What values do you hold in the highest regard? What traits make you admire a person?
</details>

## My Blind Spots


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Recommended Section: Everyone needs help sometimes. This is a good section to list the things you know you need help with or actively want feedback on. One caveat is that listing something here doesn't automatically excuse it! If you know you need to work on a particular area then please make sure you are doing so, soliciting feedback to measure your progress.
</details>

## My Pet Peeves


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: It might be tempting to use this section to vent, that's absolutely fine but the more constructive the better. If there are simple things people can reasonably avoid doing, then list them here. Bear in mind that you will also need to also read your squad members' pet peeves section, it's a 2 way street.
</details>

## Other


<details>
    <summary>Tips</summary>
Optional Section: There are some sections that are deliberately omitted from this template, but which arguably should be here - depending on your role, how comfortable you are sharing with your team etc. You may want to include these or use them as inspiration for your own.

- "How I like my 1:1s" - This might be more relevant for managers to set expectations of their direct reports. Although direct reports certainly should have a say in how their 1:1s are structured
- "Quirks" - While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.
- "How to interpret my calendar" - If you're someone with wall to wall meetings every day it might be difficult for colleagues to find a good time to speak with you. If this is the case, then this section might be helpful to outline when you typically could make time for them.
- "What you can expect from me" - Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
